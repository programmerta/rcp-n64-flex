## Ordering Guide
> [!IMPORTANT]
> When ordering through a site such as JLCPCB, make sure you select an "FR4" stiffener at a 1.0mm thickness. This stiffener adds rigidity to the mounting points on the cart itself, so I wouldn't skip this to cut costs. You could try ordering with Polyimide to see if it's cheaper.

Under "PCB Remark", add the following message:

> [!NOTE]
> Please apply the stiffener to the bottom of the flex as shown in the stiffener.gbr file. The circles on that layer should be holes in the stiffener as well.

It is very important that the stiffener is on the BOTTOM of the flex, and not the top. The silkscreen on the flex mentions this as well.
